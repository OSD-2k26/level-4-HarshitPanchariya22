# 🧩 LEVEL 4 

Time was broken — not once, but twice.

You must recreate the damage to understand the cure.

---

## 🧩 Your Mission

Create a timeline with **mistakes preserved**.

1. Create a file named `artifact.txt` with **correct content**
2. Commit it
3. Break the file in a new commit
4. Attempt to fix it — but fail
5. Restore correctness **without deleting history**

⚠️ You must NOT rewrite history  
⚠️ You must NOT delete commits  

The past must remain visible.

## 🧠 The Rule of Time

If you erase the past, you fail.  
If you undo the past **properly**, you pass.

Choose wisely.

---

## ✅ Success Conditions

- `artifact.txt` is correct **now**
- History shows the mistake
- History shows the undo

---

 *The timeline remembers everything.*
